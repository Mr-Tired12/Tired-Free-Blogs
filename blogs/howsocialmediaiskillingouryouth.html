          <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">According to me, Social Media is killing our youth blatantly and the way our youth is getting influenced by random people on the Internet makes me think, “How Will Our Generation Survive In Future ?”. Body Shaming, Racism, Narcissism, Fake Feminism, Obsession, etc. is taking over our youth. Kids aren’t kids anymore, They try to act older than there age. Using strong language is now a trend in these “KIDS” and the one who doesn’t take part in this so called “TREND” is considered a inferior and often gets bullied, While the one’s who use strong language frequently are considered to be “COOL” in this new Gen Z era. Disrespecting there teachers is a “TREND”. Watching adult videos is now a “TREND”. Not studying is “TREND”. Disrespecting elders is a “TREND”. Getting obsessed to a content creator, social media, kpop, etc. is a “TREND”. But still some part of our youth is actually trying to make this human society better. Well here are some stats that show how our youth is getting slowly eaten away by this Social Media “VIRUS”.
      <br> 

Social media is destroying our youth. The internet was meant to connect people but now it's become a place where we can bully others anonymously. The most common form of bullying is through comments on someone's weight or appearance on Facebook or Instagram. These kinds of comments can be really harmful because they're from people who are supposed to be your friends or even family members.


We all know how hard it is to grow up in today's world as it is, without having people make fun of you online too. I think we should all take a step back and think about how our words might affect other people before we post them online because what happens on the internet stays on the internet forever and it's hard to forget something mean someone said about you behind your back or even right to your face!
 It's a place where people can post the best parts of their lives and make themselves look like they have it all together, when in reality they might be going through something difficult. It's easy to compare yourself to other people on social media and think that they have more than you or are more than you. It's not always true, but it's hard not to see those kinds of posts without feeling some kind of way about them. And when you're feeling down about yourself or your life then comparing yourself becomes even easier because you're looking for things that make you feel bad about yourself so that you can avoid them too (like comparing yourself to others).


It's also really easy on social media to compare yourself based on things like body image or wealth or education level because those things are often showcased by other people who look like they have it all together - when in reality those people probably don't have it all together either! They're just putting up a front online so that people will like them or follow them back. People want to show off their lives on social media because it makes them feel popular and cool, but it doesn't mean anything if no one is actually your friend IRL.</p>
